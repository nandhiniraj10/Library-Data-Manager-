<h2>Project abstarct:</h2><br>
The Book Management System is a Django web application designed to facilitate the management of book-related data. It allows users to submit and store information about books, including the name, contact details, address, and associated amounts. The application features a user-friendly interface that enables easy data entry and retrieval. Users can input their details through a simple form, and upon submission, the data is saved to the database and displayed back to the user. This project serves as a foundational tool for managing book-related transactions, making it useful for libraries, bookstores, or personal collections. Future enhancements may include features such as search functionality, user authentication, and data analytics to provide deeper insights into the book management process.
